<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Daisies are beautiful wildflowers that provide an important source of food for wildlife. Pollinating insects like bees, butterflies, beetles feed on the pollen and nectar, earwigs and other minibeasts eat the petals and snails, slugs and mammals like rabbits and deer eat the whole daisy plant. Some species of bird even feed on the seeds.

<P>Daisies are incredibly adaptable and grow in a variety of climates across the world, they can be found on every continent except for Antartica and thrive in both dry, wet, sunny and shady areas. Did you know daisy species make up an incredible 10% of all types of flowering plants on Earth? Try some of these activites for five days (Monday through Friday). Here is a suggested list of activities involving daisies.

<P>Monday-Go on a wildlife safari amongst the daisies.
You will often find pollinating insects like bees, beetles, butterflies and moths on or around daisy flowers feeding on the nectar. You might even spot other species insects hiding under the petals, leaves or on the stems. The undersides of flowers and plants are often teeming with insects, eggs, caterpillars and larva that you would normally overlook. Itâ€™s the perfect place for them to shelter away from predators, wind and rain as well as often providing a source of food. You could take a notepad or camera with you to record your finds or even print out some nature bingo or scavenger hunt sheets.</P>

<P>Tuesday-Play a pollination game
You can learn how insects pollinate daisies and other flowering plants by playing a simple pollination game. All you need for this is a large sheet of paper or cardboard, recycled milk bottle tops, a stick, string, glue and paint. First you need to paint daisy flowers across the surface of your picture. A few of them need to be big enough to place the milk bottle tops in the centre.</P>

<P>Wednesday -Daisy chains
Making daisy chains is a simple childhood activity that is perfect for developing fine motor skills and hand and eye co-ordination. All you need to do is use a finger nail to make a small cut/hole through the base of a daisy stem, you then thread the stem of another daisy through this hole and then insert a cut into the stem of that daisy and so and so forth until you have formed a chain of daisies. You can then have fun turning your daisy chains into bracelets, necklaces, headbands or decorations.</P>

<P>Thursday -Daisy nature art
Nature art (also sometimes called land art) is a wonderful nature activity that encourages creativity and fine motor skills in children of all ages and abilities. All you need is some imagination and natural materials to make a picture. If you grow daisies in your garden you can use them to make some bright and beautiful nature art pictures and patterns.</P>

<P>Friday -Nature Painting
Nature painting is a simple activity for children of all ages, Just dip daisy flowers and leaves into paint and use them as natural paintbrushes or paint, print and mark make with. How about experimenting with other different natural materials to see what variety of marks you can make by using different shapes and textures.</P>
